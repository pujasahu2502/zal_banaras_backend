                <p>Reef Reaper</p>
                <p>This lightweight stainless steel anchor is designed to hold your boat in place over any structure that the tines can
                    get behind or wedged into. The Reef Reaper is designed to be bent if you cannot work it free. The tines can then be
                    bent back into place for repeated use. It is important to use 12-15 feet or more of 1/4” or larger chain so the
                    anchor is weighted down and can grab and hold the bottom structure. Works great in both fresh and salt water
                    anchoring over any bottom the tines can grab into. Made in the USA.</p>',
